# Installation

## Prerequisites

CrateReloaded requires either the Bukkit or Spigot API. Note that the official vanilla minecraft server is not supported.
At this current moment, we do not support Sponge.

**CrateReloaded from [Spigot - Free](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mystery-crate-crate-reloaded.861/), 
[Spigot - Premium](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/.3663/),
[Bukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/crate-reloaded/)**

?> CrateReloaded has optional dependencies to improve ease-of-use. 

### Optional

1. ** Vault **
2. ** Essentials **
3. ** Citizens **

## Installation

1. In your server folder, create a `plugins` folder if one does not exist.
2. Drag and drop the `CrateReloaded.jar` into your plugin's folder.
3. Start up the server.
4. Awesome! You can now start customizing the plugin!
