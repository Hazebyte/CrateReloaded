# Configuration

Once your server has CrateReloaded installed, you will find the main YAML files inside
**{server}/plugins/CrateReloaded** folder:

* [config.yml](config/config.md)
* [crate.yml](config/crate.md)
* block.yml
* npc.yml

## [config.yml](config/config.md)

Holds generic settings such as *prefix, formatting, and modifers.* You will find settings that allow you to modify the plugins configuration in this file.

## [crate.yml](config/crate.md)

This is where you would configure custom crates. Crates may be interpreted as kits, packs, or
a set of rewards and can consist of anything you desire.

## Others

The following are automatically generated storage files used for storing plugin data, and won't need any an explanation.

* block.yml
* npc.yml
